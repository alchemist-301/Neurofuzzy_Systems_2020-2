% P12: Competitive NN by Pablo Dominguez

% Generate 5 sets with 10 random values each
% • Multiply/divide/add/subtract each set by a different factor such that you separate
% the sets slightly
% • Plot all the points, each set in a different colour (please do not use yellow)
% • Propose initial values for the weights as random (you need one weight per class)
% • Plot the weights with a different symbol each
% • Train the network to classify the 5 sets. (Ask the user for the number of epochs)
% • Test the network for all possible values in the cartesian plane such that you
% include the whole range of your random separated sets. Plot each class in a
% different colour
% • Upload your report including the code and the graphs, before and after the
% trainning
