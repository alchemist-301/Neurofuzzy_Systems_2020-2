%We deep into membership functions of fuzzy sets, including:
%   Discrete Sets: Triangular, Trapzoidal
%   Continous Sets: Gaussian, Sigmoide, Bell

%For figure 1: Over the following MF's
%   universe: [0 200], step = 0.5
%   Triangular: a = 50, b = 50, c = 150 *purple*
%   Trapezoidal: a = 0, b = 0, c = 45, d =  80 *green*
%   Trapezoidal: a = 150, b = 155, c = 200, d = 200 *pink*
